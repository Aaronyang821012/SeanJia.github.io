            This is a unit calculator written in Java that can understand units, define new units, evaluate expressions with units,
            and simplify them by normalization. The core part is implemented by 
            Xuanpei Ouyang and me (Zhiwei Jia). We built a parser as well as an interpreter for this
            software. Please notice that owing to its recursive algorithm, this calculator is right-associative. I deployed it on the server
            side using Java servlet with a unit database. Cookies are utilized for storing user&apos;s history (with a maximum size).
          </p>
          <p>
            Here are the instructions for this calculator. Type in expressions with units, e.g., 2m + 3m will result 5m.
            You can also define new units, e.g., def lightspeed 300000km/s. For multiple units, normalization is performed
            automatically, as 6m / 3m will result in 2m. Implicit normalization is supported by type in #, e.g.,
            # lightspeed will return 300000000.0 meter second^-1. As Java is case-sentivie, please notice that 5M is not
            the same quantity as 5m. Good luck and enjoy! View source code at <a href="https://github.com/SeanJia/UnitCalculator" target="_blank">github</a>.
