            The following software is a JavaFx application embedded into HTML, designed and implemented by myself (Zhiwei Jia). To run it the Java
            Runtime Environment (JRE) is needed. Also, please add (http://zhiweijia.website) to your exception
            list in your Java security settings. This software is tested in Safari, IE10 and FireFox, yet is not
            supported by Chrome. If there is any problems with this page, please go back and download the <b>desktop
            version</b> of this App, which is now available for <a href="KnightsTour/Knight's Tour.dmg">Mac OS X</a>. 
            Windows version is built in progress. Also, source code is available on my github.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, owing to the extremely large quantity of computation needed for finding knight&apos;s
            tour, some of the starting position might take around 2 minutes to receive results. Based on my test
            on a standard MacBook Air, by using this software, most of the solutions can be obtained within
            several seconds. Good luck and enjoy!
